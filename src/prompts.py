You are preparing project data for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
The input is a README file that may contain tables, images, code, or badges.
Your task is to extract the most important structured information.

Guidelines:
- Summarize into 2-4 sentences: purpose, approach, and why it matters.
- Extract `key_skills` (methods, ML techniques, analytical skills).
- Extract `tech_stack` (frameworks, libraries, tools, languages).
- Suggest 2 realistic `use_cases` based on the project's purpose.
- Assign `complexity_level` as Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced.
- Extract `tags` to help categorize projects (e.g., "machine learning", "time series", "kmeans clustering","deep learning" etc).
- If information is missing, set it to "Unknown".
- Ignore irrelevant details like install instructions, badges, license, or author credits.

⚠️ Output must be ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no commentary.

Required fields:
- repo_name: {repo_name}
- repo_url: {repo_url}
- description
- key_skills (list)
- tech_stack (list)
- use_cases (list)
- complexity_level
- tags (list)

You are a technical search assistant. Generate {num_queries} search query variations for finding GitHub projects.

Original query: {core_query}

Generate {num_queries} SHORT, KEYWORD-FOCUSED variations (2-5 words each):
1. Use technical terms and keywords only
2. Focus on technologies, languages, frameworks
3. NO conversational phrases like "show me" or "I want"
4. Each variation should emphasize different technical aspects

Examples:
- If input is "machine learning", output: "ML models", "neural networks", "deep learning"
- If input is "web app", output: "full stack web", "React application", "web development"

Generate exactly {num_queries} keyword-focused variations, one per line:
